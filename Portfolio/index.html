   <h2> <em> About Me </em> </h2>
   <p>   I like to think of myself as an adventurer, ready to trying new things and excited to tackle everyday challenges.  This past November I started my journey to become a full stack web developer through the Laguardia CC Techhire Program. </p>

   <p> Becoming a full stack developer allows me to exhibit my creative side and use websites as my canvas. Creating software and building websites that make a positive difference in the lives of many people is something I hope to achieve as a full stack web developer. Join me on my techhire journey! </p>

   <h2> <em> Past Experiences </em> </h2>
   <p> My journey began with a background in biology and environmental research, which has helped shaped my interests and worldview such as in environmental stewardship.</p>

   <p> My interests include learning about topics at the intersection of biology and technology like in medicine, healthcare and biotechnology. As an artist, I enjoy drawing, painting, and using different combinations of colors and textures to create interesting pieces.</p>

   <h2> <em> Hobbies </em> </h2>
   <p> My hobbies include fishing, swimming, rockhounding, and creating interactive games using Javascript.</p>

   <p>My favorite hobby is rockhounding which is looking for rocks at the beach or different pay to dig mines </p>
